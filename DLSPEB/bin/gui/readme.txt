Basic info
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
GUI is the main class.  Calling the main method in it initializes the GUI
All the other classes are for dancer function popups
If there are 10 lines and you try to add to line 12+ it adds to line 11 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things Mark should know
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hit ctrl+f and type "Run" to get to the part that executes if the user clicks run
masterTree is the arraylist containing all the instructor commands
dancerTree is the arraylist containing all the dancer commands
Those need to be sent to some function in your code
If you want, you can call the virtual world here or in your code
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known bugs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doesn't check if the line number is a line number instead of a symbol or letters
Delete line sometimes doesn't delete a blank line at the end(not sure how this works)
Closing the popup boxes for dancer functions doesn't display the GUI(hopefully I'll get this done)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things I will fix or add late tonight/some time tomorrow well before class
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run doesn't add text properly for functions to arraylist
Delete line doesn't delete endDefine, endWhile, etc.
Delete line gets added to the end 
If, while, set, perform don't do pop up boxes yet
